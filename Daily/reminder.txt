so now i want to design an app with the following functions:
1. first, when the user click the app, it will bring the user to an interface to login. users need to sign in with there email or gmail
2. if the user havent create an account yet, there will be a sign up button for them to register with their email, if click the button, it will turn to the create account screen to create
3. once the user has an account, they need to login:
  if wrong password: show wrong password
  if email not registered yet: show email not found/ not registered yet
  if correct email with password: login successfully
4. now the user can log in to there goal's screen
5. in the goal screen, the user can add and delete their goals, and there will be a check box for the user to click if they have finish the goal.
6. at 23:59 everyday, this app will send notifications to the user of the daily wrap up
