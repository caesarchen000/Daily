=====
SYNOPSIS:

mps <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

This program supports computing the number of chords in the maximum planar subset in a circle of n chords

=====
DIRECTORY:

bin/	  executable binary
doc/	  reports
inputs/   input data (all chords in the planar)
outputs/  output result (number of chords in max planar subset in the input circle of n chords and those chords in an increasing order)
lib/	  library
src/ 	  source C++ codes
utility/  checker
======
HOW TO COMPILE:

	Under the root directory of this PA, simply type
	make
======
HOW TO RUN:

	cd bin/
	./bin/mps <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
	For example,
	under <student_id>_pa2
	./bin/mps inputs/1000.in outputs/1000.out
======
HOW TO CHECK ANSWER:
	COMPILE first:
		cd PA2/
		g++ ./utilities/check_answer.cpp -o utilities/check_answer
	CHECK:
		cd PA2/
		./utilities/check_answer.exe <output_file_name>
======
OTHER NOTICE: When the size of the input is too big, it might be killed in PC, but it still work on edaunion.
			  check_answer.cpp will return error if there are two chords intersecting.
