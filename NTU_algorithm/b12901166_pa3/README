=====
SYNOPSIS:

cb <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

This program supports computing the min weight of removed edges to make the graph acyclic

=====
DIRECTORY:

bin/	  executable binary
doc/	  reports
inputs/   input data (all edges and vertices in the graph)
outputs/  output result (the min weight of removed edges to make the graph acyclic and those edges)
lib/	  library
src/ 	  source C++ codes
checker/  checker
utility/  checker
======
HOW TO COMPILE:

	Under the root directory of this PA, simply type
	make
======
HOW TO RUN:

	cd bin/
	./bin/cb <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
	For example,
	under <student_id>_pa2
	./bin/cb ./inputs/public_case_1.in ./outputs/public_case_1.out
======
HOW TO CHECK ANSWER:
	CHECK:
		cd PA2/
		./checker/pa3_checker <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
======
OTHER NOTICE: Sometimes if this program can't be run in EDAunion, it might because of some UB problem. We can either use our local computer to do it, it might be correct.
